                    <h3>EE Wilson Archery Range</h3>
                    <p>The EE Wilson Archery Range is an outdoor range located about 10 miles north of Corvallis. 
                        This range is owned and operated by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and 
                        is open to the public. It has a maximum shooting distance of 100 yards. Depending on the time of year, 
                        the range may be muddy and/or cold, so please dress accordingly.</p>
                    <p>The club meets on-campus at Dryden hall about 30 min before practice to carpool to this range. (See "On-campus meeting spot" below).</p>

                    <h3>OSU Equestrian Center Horse Arena</h3>
                    <p>The OSU Equestrian Center Horse Arena is located about two miles west of campus 
                        and offers a maximum shooting distance of 20 yards. Please note that unlike EE Wilson, 
                        this location is only available to shoot at during official Archery Club practices. Additionally, it is extemely important 
                        that participants <strong>do not leave behind any arrows or other objects</strong> on the floor of the arena, as they are a danger to the horses that use the space.
                        <p>Our club meets on-campus at Dryden hall to carpool to this range (See "On campus meeting spot" below). Note that this 
                        range is also within biking distance and accessible via the Campus Way and Walnut Blvd bike paths.</p>
