                  <h3>Q: Do I need prior archery experience to attend?</h3>
                  <p>A: No! Our club is very beginner-friendly and we provide instruction and equipment. Most of our new members have little to no experience.</p>
                  <h3>Q: When are practices?</h3>
                  <p>A: See <a href="practices#practice-schedule-header">practice schedule</a>.</p>
                  <h3>Q: Where are practices?</h3>
                  <p>
                    A: Our club practices at the OSU Equestrian Center and EE Wilson Archery Range. You can either go to the range directly or meet us on campus to carpool there. See <a href="locations#locations-header">Locations section</a>.

              </div>
              <h3>Q: How much of a commitment is archery club?</h3>
                  <p>A: We are a very casual club and there is no requirment to attend a certain amount of practices—most members don't show up to every practice. It's also okay if you can only attend Sundays or only attend Tuesdays. Our club hosts and participates in various competitions/tournaments but they are all optional.</p>
                  <h3>Q: What do I need to do to attend practice?</h3>
              <p>
                A: To attend practice you must <a href="https://apps.ideal-logic.com/osusee?key=F3T9-25VWY_5878-CZ4R_cccffdd5" target="_blank">sign the waiver</a> and sign up for a specific practice session on our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Ib2LbdQAXNcRkfGHw0AR-gLDZGPCrwtFFmUNzHq9UI/edit?gid=1727566993#gid=1727566993" target="_blank">sign-up sheet</a>.
              </p>
              <h3>Q: How much are club dues?</h3>
              <p>A: Your first two practices are free, so you can easily come and check things out before committing. After attending two practices, dues are $30 a term or $70 a year. If you are a USA Archery Member, it will be $30 a year instead.</p>

                  <h3>Q: Do I need to bring my own bow/equipment?</h3>
                  <p>A: Nope! We provide recurve bows (both left & right handed), arrows of various lengths, and all other equipment needed! The draw weights of our bows range from 16 pounds to 30 pounds.</p>
                  <h3>Q: Can I bring my own personal bow/equipment?</h3>
                  <p>A: Yes! You may use your own bow/equipment after a quick inspection. All types of bows are welcome at EE Wilson. However, at the Horse Arena, we currently do not allow compound bows due to safety concerns. We are working on building arrow curtains to fix this. </p>
                  <h3>Q: Does the club do competitions/tournaments?</h3>
                  <p>A: Yes! We attend monthly Archers Afield beginner tournaments in Tigard as well as other occasional beginner-friendly competitions. We also attend/host various state-level tournaments for more experienced archers.</p>
