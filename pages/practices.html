        <h3>Attending Practice</h3>

            <li>Pay membership dues ($25/term, up to $60/year). <strong>You may attend your first two practices for free!</strong></li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Your first practice</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As we practice outside, make sure to dress for the weather and wear closed-toe shoes</li>
            <li><strong>We provide all the necessary archery equipment!</strong> You are also welcome to use your own equipment</li>
            <li>At your first practice, make sure to check in with an officer so that they can perform safety training for you. This safety training ensures that members can practice archery safely and responsibly and follow range rules.</li>
