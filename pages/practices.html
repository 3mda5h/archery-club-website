                    <h3>Attending Practice</h3>
                    <p>You can attend practice any time throughout the year at any skill level! Most of our new members start with little to no archery experience, so don't be afraid to try it out! To attend club practices, you must do the following things:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sign the waiver by <a href="https://apps.ideal-logic.com/osusee?key=F3T9-25VWY_5878-CZ4R_cccffdd5" target="_blank">becoming a member on SLI<strong>*</strong></a></li>
                        <li>Pay membership dues<strong>*</strong> ($25/term, or to $60/year). <strong>You may attend your first two practices for free!</strong></li>
                        <li>Sign up on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Ib2LbdQAXNcRkfGHw0AR-gLDZGPCrwtFFmUNzHq9UI/edit?gid=1727566993#gid=1727566993" target="_blank">sign-up sheet</a> and show up to practice!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>*Note:</strong> becoming a member on SLI is seperate from paying membership dues. You must be a member (have signed the waiver) to come to practice, but you only need to pay dues after attending 2 practices.</p>

            <h3>Your first practice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>As we practice outside, make sure to dress for the weather and wear closed-toe shoes</li>
                <li><strong>We provide all the necessary archery equipment!</strong> You are also welcome to use your own equipment</li>
                <li>At your first practice, make sure to check in with an officer so that they can perform safety training for you. This safety training ensures that members can practice archery safely and responsibly and follow range rules.</li>
